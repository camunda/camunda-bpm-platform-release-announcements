# Camunda Platform 7 release announcements

This repository contains release announcements for Camunda Platform 7.

The announcements are published in our forum in the [Camunda 7 Updates](https://forum.camunda.io/c/announcements/camunda-7-updates) category.

## Writing announcements

Create a new `announcement.md` under `releases/<minor-version>/<release-version>/`, e.g. under `releases/7.20/7.20.0-alpha5`.

If you want to reference images, place them in an `img/` directory next to the announcement markdown and reference them in a relative manner, e.g. `![image](img/myImage.png)`.
